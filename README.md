A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

## Air Quality Dataset Summary

#### Dataset:

The provided dataset represents a sample of air quality measurements collected over a period of time.

Ozone: The concentration of ozone in parts per billion (ppb).
Solar.R: The solar radiation measurement in calories per square centimeter.
Wind: The speed of wind in miles per hour (mph).
Temp: The temperature recorded in degrees Fahrenheit (Â°F).
Month: The month of the year when the data was collected.
Day: The specific day of the month when the data was recorded.

It's worth noting that in the provided dataset, there are some missing values denoted by "NA" entries.

#### Dashboard:

The dashboard analyses the distribution of the given parameters and how each of them individually affect the temperature variation. 

Ozone: Gives a distribution a right-skewed distribution or positively skewed distribution. 
Typically, Mean > Median/Mode

Solar : Gives a distribution a left-skewed distribution or negatively skewed distribution. 
Typically, Mean < Median/Mode

Temp: Shows almost a normal distribution

Wind: Normal distribution

Ozone-Temp: Ozone and temperature seem to have a strong positive correlation with ozone leading to rise in temperature

Solar-Temp: Based on the data available, these 2 have a weak positive coorelation

Wind-Temp: Wind has a strong negative correlation with Temp, meaning more windy the weather, the more is dip in the temperature
